- The need for websites to be device agnostic
  - contrasts, colors, responsiveness
- Clients controls configurations
  - browser types, fontsize, screen orientations, screen size

--- 
- Css has to be adaptive
- Css describes the intent instead of the outcome, which can be overridden by clients.
- Need to be aware of the relationships between
  - viewport and elements
  - parent and its element
  - sibling elements
  - Example
    - is an element defining width? is the parent defining the width ? is the child's width a percent of the parents? is it causing overflow
- The relationships is controlled by a given elements **formatting context**

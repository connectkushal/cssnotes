- Anything related to **typography** is inherited
  - `font-size, font-family, text-decoration, color, etc`
  - because of this it is common to place such rules on `body` or `html` tag
  - Browser defaults are **NOT** inherited
- Nothing related to **layout** is inherited
  - `margin, padding, height, width, position`

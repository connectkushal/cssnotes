- Anything related to **typography** is inherited
  - `font-size, font-family, text-decoration, color, etc`
  - because of this it is common to place such rules on `body` or `html` tag

  - Browser defaults are **NOT** inherited
- Nothing related to **layout** is inherited
  - `margin, padding, height, width, position`
- These elements do not inherit by default, they use browser defaults
  - `<button>` `<input>` `<optgroup>` `<select>` `<textarea>` // form related
  - when we want to make them inherit, use `font-family: inherit;`

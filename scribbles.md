- There is a lot of overriding that happens in css, and most of the time it has to do with typography.
  - basics should be kept in mind to avoid unintended behaviours.
- chrome debugger shows the user agent stylesheets which makes it easy to see if any browser defaults are being applied
- firefox's debugger has a more clean debugger imo
- `line-height` one of the few unitless properties
  - `line-height: 0.9` means 0.9 is relative to the `font-size`, or like `0.9em`
- For majority of the smaller text line-height of 1.6 looks good so setting in `head` saves efforts.
  - For large headers overriding it to between 0.9 to 1.2 appears a good fit

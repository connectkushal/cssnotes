- There is a lot of overriding that happens in css, and most of the time it has to do with typography.
  - basics should be kept in mind to avoid unintended behaviours.
- chrome debugger shows the user agent stylesheets which makes it easy to see if any browser defaults are being applied
- firefox's debugger has a more clean debugger imo
- `line-height` one of the few unitless properties
  - `line-height: 0.9` means 0.9 is relative to the `font-size`, or like `0.9em`
- For majority of the smaller text line-height of 1.5, 1.6 looks good so setting in `head` saves efforts.
  - For large headers overriding it to between 0.9 to 1.2 appears a good fit
  - all caps title 0.8 to 0.9
  - subtitle 1.2 or 1.4 between (title and body)
- Try
  - colors #414141 in body, #7d7d7d for subtitle
  - font-family "PT Serif", serif; for body, "Cinzel", serif for h1
  - margin for header 6rem 0, and h1 0 with font weight 900
  - to avoid title or subtitle spreading to the screen width for larger screens set in header max-width: 75rem with margins: 6rem auto
    - the auto centers the text by setting side margins automatically on both sides

- selecting vs inheriting property

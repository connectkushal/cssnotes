### CSS Notes

This repo has some notes on css, sass, frameworks based on sass like bulma and bootstrap5, tools/plugins for efficient coding.

These are meant for a quick revision when using css after some gap.

I find it quicker to go through some pointers on common concepts rather than googling small things when building something on the frontend after a long time.

#### DevEnv
##### Simple Setup
- `npm i -g sass`
-  vscode plugins: liveserver
-  then use liveserver plugin on vscode from index.html in the starter project and have `sass -w input.scss output.css` on the terminal

##### Using vscode
- `npm i -g vite sass`
- `vite run dev`

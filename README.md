### CSS Notes

This repo has some notes on css, sass, frameworks based on sass like bulma and bootstrap5, tools/plugins for efficient coding.

I made them for a quick revision when I'm using css after some gap.

When using css/sass after a long time, it is quicker to go through some pointers before starting to design, rather than googling small things inbetween which breaks the flow.

#### DevEnv
##### Simple Setup
- `npm i -g sass`
-  vscode plugins: liveserver
-  then use liveserver plugin on vscode from index.html in the starter project and have `sass -w input.scss output.css` on the terminal

##### Using vscode
- `npm i -g vite sass`
- `vite run dev`

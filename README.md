### CSS Notes

- This repo has some notes on css, sass, frameworks based on sass like bulma and bootstrap5, tools/plugins for efficient coding.
- I made them for a quick revision when I'm using css after some gap.
- When designing webpages after , it is quicker to go through some pointers before starting to design, rather than googling small things inbetween which breaks the flow.

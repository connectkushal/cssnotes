### CSS Notes

- This repo has some notes on css, sass, frameworks based on sass like bulma and bootstrap5, tools/plugins for efficient coding.
- I made them for a quick revision when I'm using css after some gap.
- When designing webpages after a long time, sometimes the recall time for css knowledge becomes very long or i tend to become unsure of the exact usage of som properties. I found that it is quicker to go through some pointers before starting to design, rather than googling small things in between which breaks the flow.
